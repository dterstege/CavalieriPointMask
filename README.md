CavalieriPointMask
==================

**Cavalieri Point Mask** is an *ImageJ* Plugin which converts images of biological tissues into masks of evenly spaced binary points for the sake of applying a Cavalieri-based point-counting approach to area approximation.

CavalieriPointMask was created by Dylan Terstege, a Neuroscience PhD candidate in the Epp Lab at the University of Calgary.

## 1. Installation

Cavalieri Point Mask was designed with ease-of-use at the forefront of our minds.  The installation process reflects this with a simple 3-step approach:

 **1.1 Install *ImageJ***. Ensure that ImageJ is installed.  If it was not previously installed, it can be downloaded [here](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html).
 
 **1.2 Download CavalieriPointMask.**  Download the CavalieriPointMask.ijm file to an accessible location

**1.3 Install Plugin in *ImageJ***.  Open *ImageJ* and select "Plugins > Install...".  Navigate to the newly downloaded CavalieriPointMask.ijm file and allow this to save to the ImageJ Plugins folder.
