CavalieriPointMask
==================

**Cavalieri Point Mask** is an *ImageJ* Plugin which converts images of biological tissues into masks of evenly spaced binary points for the sake of applying a Cavalieri-based point-counting approach to area approximation.

CavalieriPointMask was created by Dylan Terstege, a Neuroscience PhD candidate in the Epp Lab at the University of Calgary.
